## Abstract
We introduce the DevoLearn open-source software, a pre-trained model customized for the analysis of _C. elegans_ developmental processes. The model description, training data, and applications of the model are discussed. We also introduce the DevoLearn platform, an educational resource and software suite for analyzing a wider variety of model organisms. Future directions for the  DevoLearn software and platform conclude this paper. 

## Summary
Extracting metadata from microscopic videos/images have been one of the key steps in the process of finding emerging patterns from various biological processes. There have been many attempts to develop segmentation tools for cell shape and location (Cao, 2019a; Cao, 2019b; Chen, 2013). In particular, cell tracking methodologies provide quantitative summaries of cell centroid positions within an embryo (Ulman, 2006). Our pre-trained models (Devolearn) aim to speed up this process of collecting metadata by using robust deep learning models that can be used through a high level API. Devolearnâ€™s primary focus is the _Caenorhabditis elegans_ embryo and specifically on the early embryogenesis process. This builds upon desired functionality that was first proposed by the DevoWorm group in (Alicea, 2019). Below are some of the capabilities of the DevoLearn model (Figure 1).

* Segments images/videos of the _C. elegans_ embryo and extract the centroids of the cells and save them into a CSV file.  

* Estimating the population of cells of various lineages within the _C. elegans_ embryo and upon user request generates plots of the data.  

* Generating images of the _C. elegans_ embryo with either a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) or Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) using a ResNet-18 backbone.

## Accessibility
DevoLearn has been made available as an open-source module, available on PyPI ([https://pypi.org/project/devolearn/](https://pypi.org/project/devolearn/)) and as a Web app (https://devolearn.herokuapp.com). All the deep-learning models implemented in DevoLearn are built and trained on PyTorch. The PyPI package itself does not contain the model weights, but the models are downloaded automatically once the user imports a certain model from the package. 
  
## Statement of Need
Devolearn (0.2.0) is a Python package that aims to automate the process of collecting metadata from videos/images of the _C. elegans_ embryo with the help of deep learning models (Figure 2). This would enable researchers/enthusiasts to analyse features from videos/images at scale without having to annotate their data manually. There are a number of pre-trained models which are already in use in different contexts, but options are fewer within the unique feature space of developmental biology, in particular. Devolearn aims not just to fix this issue, but also work on other aspects around developmental biology with species-specific models.

## Technical Details  
DevoLearn 0.2.0 is optimized to segment and analyze high-resolution microscopy images such as those acquired using light sheet microscopy. The deep learning models used for embryo segmentation and cell lineage population prediction were both based on the ResNet18 architecture. Data from the EPIC dataset (Murray, 2012) was used to train the GAN (beta) and the lineage wise cell population prediction model. The embryo segmentation model was trained on a dataset sourced from Cao (2019b). Data for the hyperparameter tuning training set was acquired from the Cell Tracking Challenge (http://celltrackingchallenge.net/).
  
### Hyperparameter Optimization
A training pipeline was built using data from the in order to enable Optuna trials. Training involved image augmentation, which were define using Albumentations. Gaussian noise was also added to the in training images in the augmentation step. During the Optuna trials, optimize the learning rate and batch size to maximize the IOU score. Ran 100 Optuna trials, a single epoch each, on 10% of available data.
  
Optuna is a hyperparameter optimization framework capable of automating the process of hyperparameter tuning. The range of our sampled hyperparameters were as follows: Learning rate: 0.5e-3 to 20e-3, Batch Size: 8 to 64. Each trial trained the model on 10% of available data for three epochs, and returned the resulting IOU score. The hyperparams from the best optuna trial is shown in Figure 3.

### Meta-feature Detection
DevoLearn is also capable of extracting _meta-features_ that identify movement patterns and multicellular physics in the embryogenetic environment. Examples of this include embryo networks (Alicea and Gordon, 2018) and motion features. The former capability involves extracting potential structural and functional networks using distance metrics and other information extracted from microscopy images. Motion features can also be extracted and can be used for a variety of purposes, including as a means to build generative adversarial network (GAN) models (Goodfellow, 2014). Feature Pyramid Networks (FPNs) enable semantic feature maps (Lin et.al, 2016), which can also be used to approach the identity of anatomical and other biological features in new ways.

Devolearn has been built to be very data science friendly and to be highly compatible with libraries like NumPy (Harris, 2020) and Pandas (Virtanen, 2020) As the Devolearn framework (Figure 4) grows bigger with more tools and deep learning models, the combination of beginner friendliness and support for data science functionality will enable exciting scientific explorations both in developmental biology and data science.   

## DevoLearn platform
The DevoLearn PyPI package is a part of the DevoLearn Github organization (https://github.com/devolearn), which serves as a comprehensive open-source research and educational resource. This platform consists of a model library that has more general Machine Learning models for a wider range of model organisms, theory-building activities, and data science tutorials submitted by different contributors. It aims to provide users with Data Science tutorials, web-based applications that offer other Deep Learning and Machine Learning tools for cell segmentation, and other educational resources.  We invite new collaborators to join us on a continual basis in maintaining and expanding the capabilities of the DevoLearn organization.

## Future Directions  
DevoLearn has been developed and improved upon over several model improvements and benchmarking exercises. This has included improvements to the main image segmentation algorithm, which utilizes various deep learning approaches to identify cell boundaries, asymmetries and complex geometries, and the emergence of dividing cells. We plan on building upon these techniques with a focus on defined semantic segmentation techniques and training on a wider variety of datasets. 
  
One drawback of using _C. elegans_ as a model organism is that its developmental dynamics are restricted to a deterministic set of cell division events. Using other species to train the main Devolearn model, in addition to integration with other models, is critical. As the DevoLearn platform already includes some of these alternative models, integration of the user interface is key. We also look to integrate the auxilliary resource of DevoLearn into this effort, including the DevoZoo resource, which provides learners with sample data for a number of model organisms from throughout the Eukaryotic domain of life.
